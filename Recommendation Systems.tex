	\section{Recommendation Historical Trends}
In 1988, Mr. Joe Simpson, an English mountain climber, wrote a book called \textit{Touching the Void}.  It got good reviews but was considered as modest success and it was soon forgotten.

However, a decade later, an interesting thing happened. Mr. Jon Krakauer wrote a book called \textit{Into Thin Air}, a thriller about a
mountain-climbing tragedy, which became a publishing sensation. Suddenly, \textit{Touching the Void} started to sell again.
