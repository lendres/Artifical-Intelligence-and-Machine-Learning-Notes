{
	type=stats,
	name=interquartile range,
	description={A measure of statistical dispersion (also be called the mid-spread, middle 50 percent, or H-spread).  It is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data $\left(\quartilethree{}-\quartileone{}\right)$}

{
	type=stats,
	name=probability distribution function,
	description={A function whose value at any given sample in the sample space can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be close to that sample.  It applies to a continuous random variable (not discrete)}

{
	type=stats,
	name=p-value,
	description={The probability a calculated test statistic has a more extreme result than a under the null hypothesis.   A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.  Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected}

{
	type=stats,
